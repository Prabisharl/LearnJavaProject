//Branching Statement: Branching statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program based on certain conditions. They help the program "branch" or "decide" which part of the code should run.
//Branching includes both conditional and unconditional control flow changes.
/*
Branching Statements → Includes Conditional statements + other flow control statements
Example: break;      // Exits loop or switch
continue;   // Skips current loop iteration
return;     // Exits from method
if, switch  // Conditional Branching
 */

//Conditional Statement:Conditional statements are used to check conditions (true or false) and execute code accordingly.
//Conditional statements are a part of branching statements (used for decision making).
/*
Conditional Statements → Always check a condition (True/False)
Example: if (marks >= 50) {
   System.out.println("Pass");
}
